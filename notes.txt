This is a test of Steganography.

I will use this to make a image generation model, that will encrypt passwords.

This would be an example of the image to encryption and decryption set.

Now I would do is to make a script that gets in touch with dale and generates the image so you dont have to upload anything then,
that image is save in a database, where the system will get to it encrypt the information requested, 
and you can pick and choose where to save those images, they can always be decrypted using the future exe.
